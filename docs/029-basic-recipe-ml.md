# Basic recipe for machine Learning

1. Does your algorithm have high bias? - eavluate training set performance)
    - if yes, try bigger networks
    - if yes, try traing longer
    - if yes, different NN architecture

    Until get rid of Bias
    - if no, go to 2
2. Do you have high variance? - evaluate dev set performance
    - if yes, get more data
    - if yes, try regularization
    - if yes, different NN architecture

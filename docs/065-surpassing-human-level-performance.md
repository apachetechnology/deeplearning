# Surpassing human-level performance

Machine learning progress gets harder as you approach or even surpass human-level performance

## Example:
Let's say you have a problem where a team of humans discussing and debating achieves 0.5% error, a single human 1% error, and you have an algorithm of 0.6% training error and 0.8% dev error.

| type           | err  | err2 |
| -------------- | ---- | ---- |
| Team of humans | 0.5% | 0.5% |
| One human      | 1%   | 1%   |
| Training Error | 0.6% | 0.3% |
| Dev Error      | 0.8% | 0.4% |
|                |      |      |
| avoidable bias | 0.1% |      |
| variance       | 0.2% |      |

Once surpass the human error, then making progress on the machine learning problem are just less clear.

## Problems where ML significantly surpasses human-level performance

There are many problems where machine learning significantly surpasses human-level performance. 
* **Online advertising**, estimating how likely someone is to click on that. Probably, learning algorithms do that much better today than any human could
* **Making product recommendations**, recommending movies or books to you.
* **All logistics predicting** how long will take you to drive from A to B
* **load approves** predict whether someone will repay a loan, and therefore, whether or not you should approve a loan offer.

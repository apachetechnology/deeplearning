# Build your first system quickly, then iterate

If you're working on a brand new machine learning application, you should build your first system quickly and then iterate.

## Speech recognition example

There are specific techniques for making speech recognition systems more robust to noisy background.
* Noisy background
  - cafe noise
  - car noise
* Accented Speech
* Far from microphon
* Young shildren's Speech
* Stuttering

Even experts still find it maybe a little bit difficult to pick without spending some time thinking about the problem.

So, build a system quickly and then iterate.
1. Set up dev/test set and metric.
2. Build initial system quickly
3. Use bias/variance analysis & error analysis to prioritize next steps.
